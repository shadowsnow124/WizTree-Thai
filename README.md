To use the Thai translation of WizTree, follow these steps:

2. Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file.
3. Copy the extracted files to the WizTree installation directory, typically located at: `C:\Program Files\WizTree\`
4. Restart WizTree if it is already running.

## Usage

Once the files are copied to the WizTree installation directory, the application should automatically detect and use the Thai language pack. If the language does not change automatically, you can manually set the language from the WizTree settings menu.
